# Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

# You may assume the following rules:

# A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
# Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
# A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
