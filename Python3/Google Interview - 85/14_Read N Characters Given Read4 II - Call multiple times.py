# Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method read to read n characters. Your method read may be called multiple times.

# Method read4:

# The API read4 reads four consecutive characters from file, then writes those characters into the buffer array buf4.

# The return value is the number of actual characters read.

# Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE *fp in C.

# Definition of read4:

#     Parameter:  char[] buf4
#     Returns:    int

# buf4[] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4[].
