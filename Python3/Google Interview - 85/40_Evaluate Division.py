# You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values, where equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i]. Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.

# You are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the jth query where you must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.

# Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.

# Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

# Note: The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.

# Time Complexity: O(Mâ‹…N), N: iterate equations build a graph, M: query size
